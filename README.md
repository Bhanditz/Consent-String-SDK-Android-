# Consent-String-SDK-Android
Transparency and Consent Framework Consent String SDK


Encode and decode web-safe base64 consent information with the IAB EU's GDPR Transparency and Consent Framework.

This library is a reference implementation for dealing with consent strings in the IAB EU's GDPR Transparency and Consent Framework.
It should be used by anyone who receives or sends consent information like vendors that receive consent data from a partner, or consent management platforms that need to encode/decode the global cookie.

The IAB specification for the consent string format is available on the IAB Github (section "Vendor Consent Cookie Format").

This library fully supports the version v1.1 of the specification. It can encode and decode consent strings with version bit 1.

IAB Europe Transparency and Consent Framework
In November 2017, IAB Europe and a cross-section of the publishing and advertising industry, announced a new Transparency & Consent Framework to help publishers, advertisers and technology companies comply with key elements of GDPR. The Framework will give the publishing and advertising industries a common language with which to communicate consumer consent for the delivery of relevant online advertising and content.

Framework Technical specifications available at: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/InteractiveAdvertisingBureau/GDPR-Transparency-and-Consent-Framework.
